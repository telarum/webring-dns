# webring-dns
Host a webring, that also acts as a DNS.


## Idea

The idea is to allow a user to setup a DNS, which acts as a webring: It has the capability to showcase all of its known sites/nodes, like a webring would.

The main config file is dns.toml.

I've included an example script, `gen.py`, to showcase how this could be presented to the end user.
